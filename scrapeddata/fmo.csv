FMO wants to provide emergency grants where needed to its clients in the affected areas. For this project, FMO will provide EUR 50,000 to its investee client Takura II Feeder to support local communities in rebuilding their businesses and homes.  On 15 March 2019, Cyclone Idai hit the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe, after causing mass devastation in Mozambique. With the cyclone came winds in excess of 200km/hr, as well as some of the heaviest rains the region has experienced, which caused rivers to burst their banks, as well as catastrophic landslides. The cyclone lasted about 2 days and resulted in loss of human life, loss of livestock and crops, partial and complete destruction of many homes, clinics and schools, and has put the livelihoods of many communities in the affected areas under a great deal of stress. Two provinces, Manicaland and Masvingo, were most affected by the cyclone, and as of 30 April 2019, the International organization of Migration (IOM) estimated that 270,000 individuals had been affected, with 90,000 in need of emergency shelter and non-food items. 50,905 people were displaced in the 12 affected districts of Manicaland and Masvingo. Attached in Annex 1 is a basic map of the affected areas.  Many of the areas that have been affected by Cyclone Idai are home to small-scale farmers, whose livelihoods depend on agriculture. As a result of the destruction by the cyclone, many of these farmers have been affected through the destruction of lands, as well as loss of crop stocks, inputs (such as fertilizers) and farming implements. Cairns, which is one of Takura’s portfolio companies, works with various individual farmers and irrigation schemes in the area, and has seen first-hand the devastating effects being experienced as a result of the natural disaster.', 'Why we fund this project': ' FMO aims to be the preferred partner for local prosperity and thus, support its clients and investees in both good and bad times. Supporting Takura, its staff and its communities lies at the heart of being a good business partner.

The company along with its associates has a network of over 6,000 dealers and sub-dealers nationwide with access to almost 25 million farmers. Zuari offers a one-stop-shop service that helps to ensure that Indian farmers grow high quality products through its retail chain under the Jai Kisaan brand name. By supporting the revamp of the Goa plant, we help to improve the competitiveness and resource efficiency of Zuari: higher output with less energy consumption. This will also enable the company to expand its geographical reach to new states, where it can further extend its Jai Kisaan retail network.', 'Environmental and social rationale': ' E+S risks are categorized as Category B+ while risks are largely limited to the premises of the factory and can be mitigated with good industry practice.

The objective of FMO’s financing is to fund the development and construction of two 50MW solar PV plants.', 'Why we fund this project': ' FMO potentially funds this project as it provides an additional source of clean, renewable energy to India. India currently has a demand for electricity that exceeds its reliable generation capacity, resulting in frequent power outages. Furthermore, much of India’s current power is supplied by (imported) coal.', 'Environmental and social rationale': ' This project is considered a Category B+ project according to FMO’s Sustainability Policy. The rationale for the B+ is that while the E&S impacts associated with the project and its footprint are considered limited, generally site-specific and can be readily addressed through the implementation of standard good international industry practices, the potential cumulative impacts resulting from the Anathapuramu Ultra Mega Solar Park itself, and how these will be mitigated (by other developers) are generally unknown. The company will manage its environmental and social performance in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations and international standards, including IFC’s Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability, and the relevant EHS guidelines.  While all Performance Standards are applicable to this investment, FMO’s environmental and social due diligence indicates that the investment will have impacts which must be managed in a manner consistent with the following Performance Standards: PS 1 - Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts PS 2 - Labor and Working Conditions PS 3 - Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention PS 4 - Community Health, Safety and Security PS 5 - Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement PS 6 - Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources PS 7 - Indigenous Peoples   Based on currently available information provided by APSPCL, cultural heritage is not expected to be adversely impacted as the designated project area does not contain any archaeological sites, nor any structures that have paleontological, historical, cultural, artistic or religious values. There are no unique natural features (either tangible or intangible) present in the project area which could be impacted by the project and its activities. Hence, PS8 (Cultural Heritage) is not applicable to the project.

Kompanion is a young but quickly growing institution that promises to become the leading community development bank in Kyrgyzstan.', 'Funding objective': "" The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) extended a syndicated loan totalling a Kyrgyz som equivalent of US$ 12 million to Kompanion, already a long-standing client of the EBRD. The syndicated three-year loan comprises an A-loan from EBRD of up to US$ 4 million and a B-loan from FMO of up to US$8 million. The loan is consistent with the EBRD's and FMO's country strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic, which aims to extend local currency lending in order to build up local sources of funding and to reduce the use of foreign exchange in the country's financial system."", 'Why we fund this project': ' The proceeds of the syndicated loan will allow Kompanion to expand its lending operations to micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), especially in rural areas. It will also reduce Kompanion\'s exposure to the risk of sharp fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk is particularly relevant to microfinance institutions (MFIs). In the past, MFIs have received only foreign currency funding, and their opportunities for hedging have been constrained. With this loan we would like to extend local currency financing to more Kyrgyz businesses, to help them avoid foreign currency exchange risk. Kompanion has a well-established network and good country coverage. These will be used to channel financing to more beneficiaries across the Kyrgyz Republic to support growth of the country\'s economy. Kompanion CEO Ulanbek Termechikov said: ""As a microfinance institution focused on community development, Kompanion is pleased to have this opportunity to expand access to funding for rural micro entrepreneurs, who are mainly engaged in agricultural production throughout the Kyrgyz Republic.""'}";Financial Institutions;KOMPANION BANK CJSC;;;;

In 2015, CEDB (FMO investee company) and three smaller banks, Pathibara, Bhrikutee and Prudential, were merged into NMB. Pursuant to which, FMO received shares of NMB.', 'Funding objective': ' FMO will contribute and strengthen the financial sector (rural and urban) and indirectly continue to support the renewable energy in Nepal. FMO (is already) and will continue to create value to NMB by providing guidance in the challenging integration progress and with refining its new strategy. Also FMO will assist NMB to become market leader in managing E&S risks and having a proper and strengthened corporate governance structure in place with TA support. NMB is very open to learn from FMO’s network and understands the potential cross-pollination. Further to this, being part of on-the-ground energy focused bank in this promising hydro energy country will enhance FMO’s ambition to have a positive environmental impact. All in FMO’s role is substantial, but there is also an element of reputational and expectations risk that should be carefully managed.', 'Why we fund this project': ' In October 2015 NMB merged via a share swap with FMO/Triodos’ investee CEDB and three smaller banks Pathibara, Bhrikutee and Prudential. After the merger FMO/Triodos’s stake diluted from 14% to 3.19%. We hereby increase our stake to 20%, i.e. the minimum requirement for all new foreign shareholders into Nepali commercial banks. The merger was strongly driven and supported (more than 4 years) by FMO and Triodos through intensive and persuasive guidance by its nominee board directors and shareholders’ representatives. FMO is the only DFI active in the Nepalese banking sector and has been building on its reputation, network and relation with the Nepalese Central Bank (NRB) since it invested in CEDB in 2008. With a TA program on strategy support (ongoing), improved CG and E&S management FMO is and will continue to add value to NMB with the intension to make NMB attractive for to foreign and local investors. NMB recently became member of the Global Alliance for Banking on Values and is very open to learn from FMO’s network.  This transaction thus entails the take-over of the existing 3.19% stake (to be approved by FMO AEF & Triodos) and an additional equity investment (16.81%) increasing FMO’s stake to 20%, both with FMO-A.

FMO intends to partner with SBI-FMO Fund to co-invest, but so far FMO has underwritten the whole transaction.', 'Environmental and social rationale': ' With the merger and FMO’s further equity investment, NMB’s capital base will enable NMB to provide finance for larger (but still medium sized run of the river hydro project and corporates.

The funds will be used for capex investments, with a tenor of 10 years (2 years grace).  The new management is in the process of restarting the business and expanding processing plant from existing 500 MT/day to 800MT/day. ZSFL already invested close to USD 10 million over the last 2 years in order to refurbish the factory and plantation. The company will produce 19,000MT of sugar and 1.9 mln liter of ethanol. The bagasse (residue product of sugar processing) will be used to heat the boilers. The generation of this ‘green’ energy makes a small part of this financing green. Sugar will be sold straight to Zanzibar retail (both in 1kg and 50kg bags). The high import cost (import duties) in combination with the ability to directly serve the retail market, give ZSFL a competitive edge to produce sugar on a relatively small-scale. The company is in discussion with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) to sell the ethanol, which wil be used for special cooking stoves for low-income households. Ethanol fueled stoves are a healthier alternative to the wood-fired stoves, which have a bad effect on the peoples lungs as they are contaminating the air in small huts.', 'Why we fund this project': ' The transaction is expected to generate substantial development impact. The farm and factory are currently neglected. ZSFL will become one of the few commercial activities on Zanzibar next to tourism. The farm and factory will create approximately 200 direct and 400 indirect jobs. In the medium-run ZSFL expects to buy cane from around 1000 smallholder farmers (out growers).

USD 15.00 MLN;;Kenya;12/18/2015;"{'Who is our client': ' Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA ) is the largest tea business in East Africa, representing 60 percent of all Kenyan tea sales. KTDA was privatized in 2000 and is indirectly owned by 570,000 tea farmers, through 66 tea factories. KTDA is a management and service provider offering services to tea factories and farmers. Services included management services for factories, trading, warehousing, branding, pre-financing and power projects. The KTDA entities deduct their cost (e.g. of processing) and a fee from the final tea sales price, while the rest of the tea sales price is paid out to farmers. KTDA is consistently looking at the entire tea value-chain to see where it can cut cost and provide ancillary services. KTDA is now setting up small hydro projects, through its subsidiary KTDA Power (or the Company), to reduce energy cost, which is one of the major costs in the processing of tea. Several tea factories have joined hands to save equity to invest in a hydro project.', 'Funding objective': ' KTDA Power will design, construct, operate and maintain seven run-of-the river small-hydropower plants (SHPs) with a total installed capacity of 16MW at various locations in Kenya. The SHPs will provide captive power generation for several KTDA tea factories, and will sell any excess to the majority state-owned utility company, Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC). Each SHP will be owned by newly created asset holding companies, Regional Power Companies (RPCs). KTDA Power will have a 12.5 percent share in each RPC while the remaining shares are held by several tea factories in the region. KTDA Power will on-lend the money to the different RPC’s and in turn to different SHPs. There are four RPC’s owning seven hydro projects. By retaining factory profit, the tea factories have saved equity over several years. Total Project cost is USD 85.6 million, financed for 65 percent by debt and 35 percent by equity. Total debt package of USD 55 million is arranged by IFC. IFC will take USD 25 million (50 percent GAFSP) and FMO and Proparco both USD 15 million. FMO will participate in a B-loan financed by IDF. KTDA Holdings and its largest subsidiaries will provide a first demand corporate guarantee and unlimited deficiency support throughout the full lifetime of the loan.', 'Why we fund this project': ' The investment rationale is that captive power is imperative for the tea business: energy makes up 30 percent of total tea processing cost. To remain cost competitive, the tea factories have to reduce their energy costs. Tea-growing-areas have excellent potential for small-scale hydro\'s and there is good credit risk through corporate guarantee and full deficiency support. KTDA is a large and financially strong group with an excellent track-record. Additionally, the investment aims to have a high development impact: Generating renewable energy is marked within FMO as ""Green"". As the Group has a cooperative structure and the shareholders and ultimate beneficiaries are smallholder farmers, the deal can be marked as ""Inclusive"" as well.

The company had humble beginnings when the founder of Beefmaster started a small feedlot with eleven cattle in the 1960’s. The feedlot grew from strength to strength and Beefmaster was officially incorporated in 1986. Today, Beefmaster is one of South Africa’s most complete vertically integrated producers of beef and beef-related products. It is involved in every aspect of the beef supply chain, ranging from feed production, feedlotting, and slaughtering to distribution through local and international wholesale and retail channels. The company remains a family-owned business and the founding family is still involved in the daily operations.', 'Funding objective': ' DEGs and FMOs funding is part of a larger funding package comprising term debt, fresh equity and working capital facilities. DEG and FMO are committing senior loan and mezzanine facilities denominated in South African Rand under the Friendship Facility agreement as part of this funding package.  The primary objective of the capital and funding raise is to increase capacity utilisation of Beefmaster’s operations. The proceeds will be used to increase cattle numbers in the feedlot, for capital expenditure related to utilization increase in the abattoir, and to restructure existing debt to bring the company’s debt in line with long term requirements.', 'Why we fund this project': ' Animal production contributes approximately 41 percent to the country’s agricultural GDP. About 500,000 people are being employed by the industry and 2.1m people are dependent on the livestock industry for their livelihood. Through supporting an industry vital to the South African economy, DEG and FMO will contribute to the further development of South Africa in general, and the red meat industry in particular. The company’s expansion plans are expected to lead to an increase of 411 jobs, with most of those jobs being in the Northern Cape Province. This is one of South Africa’s least developed provinces with official unemployment close to 30 percent. Lastly, the DEG and FMO financing package will catalyse financing from a commercial bank as well as facilitate the entry of a new equity partner.'};Agribusiness, Food & Water;BEEFMASTER HOLDINGS PROPRIETARY LTD;;;;
